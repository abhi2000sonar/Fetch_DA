Subject: Summary of Key Findings and Next Steps from Fetch Data Analysis  

Hi,  

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve completed a review of the Fetch Rewards data and wanted to share some important findings, highlight areas needing attention, and outline where your input would be helpful.  

Key Data Quality Issues  
- Missing Data:  
  - The BARCODE field is missing 11.5% of entries, which could impact product-level trend analysis.  
  - Fields like MANUFACTURER and BRAND are 25.9% incomplete, limiting our ability to pinpoint product preferences.  
  - CATEGORY_4 is 92% missing, raising concerns about its usability for analysis.  

- Inconsistencies:  
  - The GENDER field has 11 unique values, suggesting inconsistent data entry. Standardization will be necessary for demographic insights.  
  - Both RECEIPT_ID and SCAN_DATE appear to have identical unique counts, which may indicate redundancy or a formatting issue.  

Interesting Trend in the Data  
- Power Users Are Key Drivers:  
  The top 10% of users, based on the number of receipts scanned, are contributing disproportionately to overall revenue. These engaged users not only scan more but also generate significant sales, indicating their high value to the business.  

- Leading Brand Insight:  
  In the Dips and Salsa category, Brand X stands out as the leader in total sales. This suggests strong customer loyalty and presents an opportunity to deepen promotional efforts or strengthen partnerships with this brand.  

Next Steps and Request for Input 

To address outstanding questions and ensure our analyses are robust, we’d appreciate your guidance on the following:  

1. Addressing Missing Fields:  
   - Can we acquire complete data for BARCODE, MANUFACTURER, and CATEGORY_4? If not, should we exclude them from the analysis or treat them as irrelevant?  

2. Standardizing Demographics:  
   - Should we clean and standardize GENDER entries (e.g., mapping M to Male)?  
   - Are there specific insights you’re looking for from demographic data, such as age, language, or location trends?  

3. Growth Metrics:  
   - Our analysis suggests year-over-year sales growth. Could you share official benchmarks or growth targets to validate our findings?  

Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any of these points or if there are other priorities you’d like me to focus on. I look forward to your feedback to refine our approach further.  

Best regards,  
Abhishek
